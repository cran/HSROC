Description: Implements a model for joint meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test under evaluation, while taking into account the possibly imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the reference test. This hierarchical model accounts for both within and between study variability. Estimation is carried out using a Bayesian approach, implemented via a Gibbs sampler. The model can be applied in situations where more than one reference test is used in the selected studies.
