		#===================================================

--- Added error messages to break the Gibbs sampler loop once NaN values are being generated.
--- Attempt at fixing bugs regarding the posterior estimate of beta parameter generating some Nan values at "random time" during simulation
--- In the creation of the SROC curve, the program was going through 90% of the total range of the credible interval of THETA and at each point calculating S and C.  The range has now being increased to 95%

		#
		#		2011-10-19 (Version 1.1.0)
		#
		#===================================================

--- Renamed the "i" argument of the HSROCSummary function to a more meaningful one : "iter.keep"

--- Changed the default values of arguments prior_LAMBDA, prior_THETA and prior_beta of function HSROC to reflect the narrower priors used in the paper.

--- Changed the TP, FP, FN, TN labels of the In.house and MRI dataset to ++, +-, -+, --

--- Fixed the trace and density plot titles for reference standard parameters.  

--- Lowered the number of studies of the In.house dataset from 12 to 11 by removing the Parandaman study

		#===================================================
		#
		#		2011-06-20 (version 1.0.11 not published)

--- Added posterior predictive values of sensitivity and specificity of a new study that has not yet taken place.

--- Added the possibility to put prior on sigma (noted "sd"), sigma_squared (noted "v") or 1/sigma_squared (precision, noted "p") for both sigma_alpha and sigma_theta.    

--- Fixed the following : If the HSROC function crashes before the requested number of iterations, the last iteration estimates are being saved in the "REstarting_values", "REstarting_values2", ... files, such that the function can be re-run from where it crashes using the "first.run=FALSE" argument.
